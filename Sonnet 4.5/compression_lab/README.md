# Compression Lab

**GPU-Accelerated Compression Algorithm Research for RTX 4070**

A self-optimizing research environment that benchmarks three novel CUDA compression algorithms on your GPU, visualizes performance in real-time, and exports results for analysis.

---

## What It Does

1. **Runs 3 CUDA compression algorithms** on diverse test data (text, binary, structured, random)
2. **Monitors GPU performance** (VRAM, power, temperature) via nvidia-smi
3. **Displays live results** in an interactive D3.js/Chart.js dashboard
4. **Logs all benchmarks** to SQLite for later analysis
5. **Generates comparison reports** showing which algorithm wins for which data type

## The Algorithms

| Algorithm | How It Works | Best For |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Arithmetic Coding** | Parallel entropy estimation + range encoding | High compression on text |
| **LZ77 Parallel** | Hash-based pattern matching with 32KB sliding window | Balanced speed/ratio |
| **E8 Lattice** (Novel) | Maps data to E8 root vectors (240 patterns) for geometric encoding | Structured/scientific data |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd "Sonnet 4.5/compression_lab"

# 2. Run benchmarks (generates test data automatically)
./scripts/run_benchmarks.sh

# 3. View live dashboard
cd dashboard && python3 server.py
# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```
